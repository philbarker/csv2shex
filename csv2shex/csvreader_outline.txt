      - And shapeID exists in shapeid_dict

        - Append to shapeid_dict:

    - Instantiates CSVShape
      - If CSVShape has a valid value for shapeID, this is used
      - If CSVShape does not have a shapeID
        - Gets latest shapeID from shapeids_list
        - For rest of the fields in CSVShape:
          - Assigns values (if present) to CSVShape
      - CSVShape validates itself
