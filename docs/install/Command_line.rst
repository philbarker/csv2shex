Command-line utility
--------------------

To get basic help, run the command with no arguments:

    $ csv2shex

The main subcommand used to read and display the contents of a CSV file is:

    $ csv2shex csvparse example.csv

Several other subcommands provide quick access to the elements of the model, picklists for specific elements, and built-in prefix bindings.

A 'yamlparse' subcommand has been implemented as proof-of-concept. A 'yaml2csv' subcommand is still just aspirational.
